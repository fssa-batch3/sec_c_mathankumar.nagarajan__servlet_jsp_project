                The most important reason for building a shopping mall has good stores for <b>
                    clothing,<br>
                    bags, shoes,</b>
                home items, jewellery, and makeup that will make your 1 door wardrobe<br>
                look beautiful. Good shopping mall should have all type of stores that includes local<br>
                brands as well as international brands. The quality level of products and customer<br>
                services plays an important role in building the mall's reputation and popularity among<br>
                the masses. Local brand shops are often preferred by shoppers who want to shop<br>
                economically, so a shopping mall is a good place for that audience to enjoy and shop<br>
                as per their budget. Also, international brands always attract people for obvious<br>
                reasons. Shoppers who always seek variety and quality have a lot of options at hand in<br>
                this way. A huge selection of stores ensures people to shop from a wide range of<br>
                products ranging from cheap to luxurious products. The more brands malls have the<br>
                more crowd it is going to attract.
